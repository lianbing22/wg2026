**Property Management Game - Scenarios & Challenges**

**1. Tenant Relations & Communication**

*   **Scenario 1: Noise Complaint.**
    *   **Challenge:** A tenant reports excessive noise from a neighboring unit. The player must investigate, communicate with both tenants, and find a resolution that satisfies both parties (e.g., warning, mediation, or no action if the complaint is unfounded).
    *   **Decision Points:** Investigate immediately or delay? Issue a formal warning or an informal request? What action to take if the noise continues?
*   **Scenario 2: Late Rent Payment.**
    *   **Challenge:** A long-term tenant is late on rent for the first time, citing a personal emergency. The player needs to balance empathy with policy enforcement.

*   **Scenario 3: Service Request Follow-up.**
    *   **Challenge:** A tenant submitted a maintenance request (e.g., leaky faucet) a week ago, and it hasn't been addressed. They are now upset. The player needs to expedite the repair and manage the tenant's frustration.

*   **Scenario 2: Appliance Breakdown.**
    *   **Challenge:** The refrigerator in a unit stops working. The tenant demands an immediate replacement. The player must decide whether to repair or replace, considering cost, appliance age, and tenant inconvenience.
    *   **Decision Points:** Repair (cheaper, but might break again soon) or replace (more expensive, but better long-term)? How quickly can a replacement be sourced and installed?
*   **Scenario 3: Seasonal Maintenance Scheduling.**
    *   **Challenge:** Winter is approaching, and the player needs to schedule HVAC servicing for all units and common areas, plus gutter cleaning. Limited vendor availability and budget constraints.

*   **Scenario 2: Unit Turnover Race.**
    *   **Challenge:** A tenant is moving out, and a new tenant is scheduled to move in just two days later. The player needs to coordinate cleaning, minor repairs (e.g., paint touch-ups), and key handover within a tight timeframe.

*   **Scenario 2: Key Maintenance Staff Calls in Sick.**
    *   **Challenge:** The primary on-site maintenance technician calls in sick on a busy day with multiple scheduled repairs and a new tenant move-in.

*   **Scenario 3: Negotiating a Vendor Contract Renewal.**
    *   **Challenge:** The contract for a key service (e.g., landscaping, security) is up for renewal. The vendor proposes a significant price increase.
