# Enhanced Engagement Mechanics Brainstorm

This document outlines potential enhanced engagement mechanics for the property management game, considering user feedback for "more fun, not just simple choices, expandability, and continuity."

## 1. Mini-Games (Short, interactive challenges)

*   **"Repair It" Quick Time Event (QTE):**
    *   *Description:* When a minor repair is needed (e.g., fixing a leaky faucet, unclogging a drain, resetting a breaker), a simple QTE sequence appears. The player might need to click specific spots in an image in order, press a sequence of keys, or stop a moving bar in a target zone within a time limit.
    *   *Fun/Engagement:* Adds a hands-on, skill-based element to routine tasks, provides immediate feedback and a sense of accomplishment or minor failure, breaks up text-heavy gameplay.
    *   *Expandability:* Different QTE patterns for various repairs, adjustable difficulty levels (time limits, complexity), potential for tool usage (e.g., "select correct tool first").
    *   *Continuity:* Repeatedly failing QTEs for the same item could lead to it breaking down more permanently, requiring a more expensive, non-mini-game solution.

*   **"Negotiation Dialogue":**
    *   *Description:* During interactions like lease renewals, vendor contract discussions, or mediating tenant disputes, a timed mini-game appears. The player chooses from dialogue options that have different tones (e.g., Assertive, Empathetic, Business-like, Deferential). Success depends on matching the tone to the NPC's current mood or objective, possibly visualized with a "persuasion bar" or "relationship meter."
    *   *Fun/Engagement:* Introduces a psychological and skill-based element to social interactions, making them more engaging than a simple choice. Offers replayability by trying different approaches.
    *   *Expandability:* More nuanced tones, NPC "personality traits" that favor certain approaches, hidden information that can be uncovered to improve chances, consequences for poor negotiation (e.g., higher price, lost tenant).

*   **"Schedule Optimizer":**
    *   *Description:* When the player needs to schedule multiple tasks (e.g., maintenance visits for different units, property viewings for prospective tenants) with limited staff or time slots, a visual puzzle interface appears. The player drags and drops tasks onto a daily or weekly calendar, trying to optimize routes, minimize travel time, or ensure high-priority tasks are done first.
    *   *Fun/Engagement:* Offers a strategic, puzzle-like challenge. Visually satisfying when tasks are arranged efficiently.
    *   *Expandability:* Different staff members with different speeds or skills, emergency tasks disrupting the schedule, traffic or travel time considerations.

*   **"Tenant Application Review":**
    *   *Description:* Instead of just seeing stats, the player reviews a simplified "application packet" with a few key details (e.g., job type, a positive trait, a negative trait/risk factor, a specific request like "needs quiet space"). The player must weigh these against property policies or ideal tenant profiles. Could involve a "red flag" system where players click on potential issues.
    *   *Fun/Engagement:* Adds a light investigation/deduction element to leasing. Makes the process feel more subjective and nuanced.
    *   *Expandability:* More complex applicant details, ability to "interview" via a short dialogue choice, checking references (another small QTE or dice roll).

## 2. Deeper Systems

*   **Dynamic Tenant "Needs & Moods" System:**
    *   *Description:* Individual tenants (or at least units) have a few core "Needs" (e.g., Quiet, Maintenance Quality, Value for Money, Safety) and a "Mood" (e.g., Happy, Content, Irritated, Angry). Player actions, scenario outcomes, and property conditions directly affect these. Moods influence their behavior (complaint frequency, lease renewal likelihood, interaction tone). This goes beyond a single global satisfaction score.
    *   *Fun/Engagement:* Makes tenants feel more like individuals, adds a layer of proactive management, creates more organic challenges as different tenants react differently.
    *   *Expandability:* More needs/moods, inter-tenant relationships (e.g., noise from one angers another), tenant "personalities" that prioritize certain needs.

*   **Staff Management & Skill Progression:**
    *   *Description:* Player can hire different staff members (e.g., handyman, cleaner, leasing agent) who have varying skill levels (e.g., repair: speed/quality; cleaning: thoroughness; leasing: conversion rate), salary expectations, and perhaps a simple "morale" stat. Staff can gain experience and improve skills through successful task completion, or their morale can drop due to overwork or negative events.
    *   *Fun/Engagement:* Adds strategic depth to resource management and task delegation. Creates a sense of team building and development.
    *   *Expandability:* Staff training options, specializations, staff-specific events or requests, payroll and budget impact.

*   **Preventative Maintenance & Building Degradation:**
    *   *Description:* Key property components (HVAC, plumbing, roof, appliances in units) have a condition status that degrades over time or due to specific incidents. The player can schedule and invest in preventative maintenance (e.g., annual HVAC service, gutter cleaning) to slow degradation and reduce the chance of costly emergency repairs. Ignoring this leads to more frequent and severe problems.
    *   *Fun/Engagement:* Encourages long-term strategic thinking and financial planning. Adds a satisfying loop of investment vs. consequence.
    *   *Expandability:* Different degradation rates for component types, specific mini-games for inspection/maintenance, impact of weather, options for full replacement vs. repair.

*   **Reputation System (Player & Property):**
    *   *Description:* The player (as a manager) and potentially individual properties earn a reputation based on actions and outcomes. This could influence vendor pricing, the quality of tenant applications, or interactions with an owner/corporate entity. For example, a property with a "poorly maintained" reputation attracts fewer good applicants.
    *   *Fun/Engagement:* Adds a meta-level goal and reflects the real-world impact of consistent good or bad management.
    *   *Expandability:* Different types of reputation (e.g., "luxury," "budget-friendly," "problem-property"), media events or online reviews affecting reputation.

## 3. Narrative/Continuity Mechanics

*   **"Property Quirks & Developing History":**
    *   *Description:* Properties aren't generic. A property might start with or develop unique "Quirks" over time (e.g., "Unit 2B has creaky floors," "The old oak tree drops lots of leaves," "The surprisingly territorial squirrel near the entrance"). These can be positive or negative and can trigger unique small events, dialogue options, or maintenance challenges. Player actions might even influence these quirks.
    *   *Fun/Engagement:* Gives each property more personality, makes the game world feel more alive and evolving, creates memorable running gags or persistent challenges.
    *   *Expandability:* Player actions directly creating new quirks (good or bad), system for "upgrading" or "mitigating" quirks through projects.

*   **Recurring Characters & Relationship Scores:**
    *   *Description:* Key NPCs (tenants, staff, important vendors) are not one-off encounters. They remember significant past interactions. A simple relationship score (e.g., -5 to +5, or categories like Friendly, Neutral, Hostile) is tracked. This score can influence their dialogue, willingness to cooperate, prices (for vendors), or tolerance for issues (for tenants).
    *   *Fun/Engagement:* Makes choices feel more meaningful and have lasting consequences beyond immediate scenario outcomes. Encourages players to think about long-term relationship building.
    *   *Expandability:* NPCs can have relationships with each other, "Gossip" system where one NPC's opinion of you affects another's, relationship-specific events.

*   **"Decision Echoes" & Long-Term Consequences:**
    *   *Description:* Specific choices made in one scenario can have direct, flagged consequences in much later scenarios. For example, opting for a cheap but shoddy repair early on could lead to a major system failure seasons later. The game could explicitly remind the player: "Remember when you opted for the cheap fix on the boiler? Well..."
    *   *Fun/Engagement:* Strongly reinforces the idea that choices matter in the long run. Creates "aha!" or "oh no!" moments when past decisions resurface.
    *   *Expandability:* Complex chains of events, where multiple previous decisions contribute to a future outcome.

*   **Evolving Neighborhood/Market Conditions:**
    *   *Description:* The external environment isn't static. Over time, the neighborhood might gentrify, decline, or see new competing properties built. This could be communicated through news snippets or market reports, affecting rental demand, tenant expectations, and property values, requiring players to adapt their strategy.
    *   *Fun/Engagement:* Adds a dynamic macro layer to the game, encouraging strategic adaptation.
    *   *Expandability:* Player choices could (slightly) influence neighborhood perception, specific events tied to market shifts (e.g., "New tech company opens nearby, demand for luxury units up!").

## Candidate(s) for Initial Prototyping:

1.  **Recurring Characters & Relationship Scores:**
    *   **Justification:** This directly addresses "continuity" and makes "simple choices" have more weight by creating persistent interpersonal consequences. It can be prototyped with a few key NPCs and a simple numerical score that modifies dialogue or scenario branches slightly. It has high impact on making the world feel more alive and choices more meaningful, with relatively moderate initial implementation complexity (compared to a full dynamic needs system, for example). It directly responds to making the game less about isolated choices.

2.  **"Repair It" Quick Time Event (QTE) Mini-Game (for one or two common, simple repairs):**
    *   **Justification:** This directly addresses "more fun, not just simple choices" by introducing a brief, interactive, skill-based element. Prototyping one or two simple QTEs (e.g., a timed button press for "unclog drain," a sequence click for "reset breaker") can demonstrate the concept quickly. It provides an immediate change of pace. Its impact is on making routine tasks more engaging, and complexity can be kept very low initially.

These two mechanics offer a good blend of enhancing narrative depth/consequence and adding direct interactive fun, both with scalable complexity suitable for initial prototyping.
